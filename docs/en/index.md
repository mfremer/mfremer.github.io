I am currently a non-tenured teaching and research fellow at [Universit√© de Lorraine](https://fst.univ-lorraine.fr/), working in the [MFX team](https://mfx.loria.fr/) at [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/), Nancy (France), where I also completed my PhD under the supervision of Sylvain Lefebvre.

My [research](/research) focuses on using computer graphics and combinatorial optimization techniques to tackle problems arising in computational fabrication. I am particularly interested in understanding how existing theoretical tools and algorithms can be used to solve problems caused by real-life constraints.

I also do quite a bit of [teaching](/teaching), which I really enjoy. In particular, I teach the basics of programming and algorithmic thinking to students new to computer science, which presents unique and interesting challenges.
