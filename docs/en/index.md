I am an associate professor at [Grenoble INP - Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en), doing research within the Geometry & Image department at [Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/spip.php?article51), in the [CRAFT team](https://www.inria.fr/en/craft).

Until 2025, I was a non-tenured research and teaching fellow at [Université de Lorraine](https://fst.univ-lorraine.fr/), working in the [MFX team](https://mfx.loria.fr/) at [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/), Nancy, where I also completed my PhD in 2024 under the supervision of Sylvain Lefebvre.

My [research](/research) focuses on using computer graphics and combinatorial optimization techniques to tackle problems arising in computational fabrication. I am particularly interested in understanding how existing theoretical tools and algorithms can be used to solve problems caused by real-life constraints.

My [teaching](/teaching) activities are documented in the corresponding section.
