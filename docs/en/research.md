## Non-tenured research and teaching fellow
I am currently working on parallel, GPU-based placement algorithms for *Field-Programmable Gate Array* (FPGA), continuing the work on layout problems that I started during my PhD.

I am also still working on mesh unfolding techniques, continuing my [previous work](/publications/2024Bhargava) on the subject.

### Lay summary
Layout problems arise in many engineering and computing domains. They consist of a set of objects, a space and a set of constraints and objectives. Finding a valid layout means placing the objects within the space while satisfying the constraints and optimizing the objectives. Electronics physical layout design and floorplanning are examples of layout problems. Often these include topological constraints, i.e. constraints relating to relationships between the objects, such as components being connected in electronic circuits or two rooms being non-adjacent in a floorplan. This thesis considers layout problems with topological constraints in computational fabrication, more specifically in the context of electronic circuit layout and support structures for 3D printing. These technologies being more accessible than ever thanks to affordable 3D printers and online electronic prototyping services means that developing techniques for them is more important than ever.

## Research internships
### M2 internship
- Title:      *Fast next-event estimation for reflection and refraction on triangles with interpolated normals*
- Supervisor: *Nicolas Holzschuch*
- Dates:      *2020-02 to 2020-06*
